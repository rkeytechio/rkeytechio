I would introduce myself in five words: **thinker**, **solver**, **challenge seeker** and **mentor**. I look at practical ways of achieving the unimaginable in work or personal life. I like my imagination without boundaries. Often try to go beyond my expectations in all roles I have in life, trying to deliver the best attainable outcome to any of my duties.

I have been a consultant and an all-rounder **full-stack software developer** in my early days. Predominantly, my experience has been in **Microsoft technologies** for more than a decade. I still love to cut code. Solve puzzles. I can not imagine myself without opening my favourite IDE Visual Studio once a day. Even on the weekend (_If time allows_) to help someone in <a

or to create a

pull request.

However, **as an architect** at present, more of my work is to assist my clients and teams in leveraging the cloud technologies like **Azure** and **Aws** and helping them thrive in their cloud adoption journey.

I am also very passionate about **DevOps** and delivering continuously improved solutions. As a **certified DevSecOps expert**, I implement security-focused DevOps best practices and train staff and business stakeholders to deliver agile projects with fast go-to-market strategies in place. Also, as a **Microsoft certified trainer**, I provide training to teams who wish to get on top of the Azure technology stack. I love evolving with technology and am never hesitant to try new things.

From a background in finance and accounting to my journey to become an architect was never a smooth one. I had to learn things the hard way. But fast. I had struggles finding the optimum and up to date solutions for problems. I may have read hundreds of blogs and watched hours of content on the internet to learn my way here. I was also privileged to have many good mentors, colleagues and friends who helped me along the way without expecting anything in return.

The **rkeytech.io** is my way of giving back to my (Tech) community. I would use this space to express my views and share my technical knowledge and best practices in various areas I have worked on and am currently learning. Consider any opinions expressed here as my own.

So this is my payback. It is my way of saying **Thank you!**
