I am a **thinker**, **solver**, **challenge seeker** and **mentor**. I look at practical ways of achieving innovation in work or personal life. I like my imagination without boundaries and always go beyond my comfort zone to deliver the best attainable outcome to my duties.

## 👨‍💻What I do
I work as a Cloud Architect, DevSecOps Evangelist and Mentor in my current role. I am a **consultant** and a **full-stack software developer** in my heart. My experience has been in **Microsoft** stack for more than a decade. I still love to cut code when I get a chance. Even on the weekend (_If time allows_) to help someone in <a

As a **Cloud Architect**, I assist my clients and teams in leveraging cloud technologies like **Azure** and **Aws** nd help them thrive in their cloud adoption journey. **DevSecOps** is my speciality and what I am passionate about the most. Beyond all, I like to share my experience and knowledge. So as a **Microsoft certified trainer**, I train teams who wish to get on top of the Azure technology stack.
