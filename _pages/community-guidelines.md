# Simple Ask

I welcome comments, questions, suggestions and discussions on my blog posts. So be open, and don't be shy. To create meaningful and valuable conversation, please stay on topic and respect other people's opinions. 

I would not have the time to review and moderate all comments. So I also need your help. If you see a conversation that should need my attention, please flag it. My ask is simple. We all are adults and professionals. Please keep it
- Respectful
- Reliable
- Relevant 
- Safe

If you like what you read, please share. On the other hand, if you find the content needs more work or improvements, I am always willing to learn. Use comments or my contacts to reach out to me. I will appreciate your input regardless its been positive or constructive criticism.

Thank you!
